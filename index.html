          <p>Often we hear that estimating a project is a must. "We can't make decisions without them" we hear often. In this session I'll present examples of how we can predict a release date of a project without any estimates, only
            relying on easily available data.</p>
          <p>I'll show how we can follow progress on a project at all times without having to rely on guesswork, and we will review how large, very large and small projects have already benefited from this in the past. At the end of the
            session you will be ready to start your own #NoEstimates journey.</p>

          <header><h3>How to enable agility in the whole organisation creating high performing companies</h3></header>
          <p>Our highest priority is to satisfy a customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Agile processes harness change for the
            customer and deliver the competitive advantage. Agile processes promote sustainable development.</p>
          <p>One of several reasons why agile techniques are so effective is that they reduce the feedback cycle between the generation of an idea and the realisation of that idea. This not only minimises the risk of misunderstanding, it
            also reduces the cost of addressing any mistakes.</p>
          <p>But most of the times we fail to take Agile further than team level. Based on my experience it is very hard to actually transform the companies and adopt Agile mindset and create high performing organisations.</p>
          <p>In this talk I will present a bunch of ideas that you can apply directly in your daily work that will allow you to bring your company to the next level of agility creating high performing organisation.</p>

          <header><h3>The systemic Scrum Master</h3></header>
          <p>Most Scrum Masters are quite fluent in "Scrum", but they lack experience in System and Complexity Thinking. Most projects don't fail because of the wrong tools, but because of people and a missing understanding about the system
            that we are all part of. I'll share stories about real world teams and their struggels with the system around them and talk about how a more systemic approach helped them. At the end of the talk you'll have a better
            understanding of system and complexity thinking and the needed mindset, as well as some tools that will help you on your systemic journey.</p>
          <p>IMHO the talk will be valuable for Scrum Masters, Product Owners and Agile Managers, who have a feeling that they got stuck and are in need for something different, the Scrum framework cannot provide.</p>

            <h3>Thursday 3rd November, All day</h3>
            <h4>#NoEstimates - How to improve software development predictability and profitability by focusing on what matters</h4>
          </header>
          <p>#NoEstimates is an approach to software development that arose from the observation that large amounts of time were spent over the years in estimating and improving those estimates, but we see no value from that investment.
            Indeed, according to scholars Conte, Dunmore and Shens a good estimate is one that is within 25% of the actual cost, 75% of the time.</p>
          <p>This is the same as saying: give us your money, we promise not lose more than 25% of it (with a 25% probability that we will lose a lot more). We don’t find that acceptable or productive for our industry. There must be better
            ways to manage software and product development.</p>
          <p>In this workshop we will review and analyze why we do estimates and how we can improve software and product development while reducing the time and money invested in estimating.</p>
          <p><strong>Workshop learning goals:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Decision making frameworks for projects that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>Investment models for software projects that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>Project management (risk management, scope management, progress reporting, etc.) approaches that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>The tools and arguments you need to prove the value of #NoEstimates to your boss</li>
            <li>How to get started applying #NoEstimates right away</li>
            <li>Where is #NoEstimates going and what are the likely changes to software development that will come next</li>

            <h3>Friday 4th November, Morning</h3>
            <h4>Agile Retrospectives – Much more than “What went well, what went wrong, what should be improved”</h4>
          </header>
          <p>The definition of Scrum Guide is: The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to: Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to
            people, relationships, process, and tools; Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and, Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.</p>
          <p>A Retrospective is much more than that. For me a retrospective is a place to raise empathy, social and emotional intelligence within the team. In this talk I will explain how Agile Retrospectives can be used as a team building
            activity and to create long lasting relationships between team members.</p>
          <p>I see most of the people running agile retrospectives in a way that does not allow learning. They run it with a bunch of activities and games but not really as a tool to enable sustainable learning. During my talk I will
            provide tools and tips that will foster sustainable learning in order for the team to continuously improve.</p>
          <p>Scrum guide definition is very focused on team level, but why not to spread the great benefits of Agile Retrospectives to the rest of the organization. If you attend my talk you will get access to a simple framework that will
            allow you to implement Agile Retrospectives into the organization level.</p>
