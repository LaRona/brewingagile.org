                        <h4><strong>Keynote</strong></h4>
                    </header>

                    <section class="talk">
                        <p>The strength of Agile lies in the simplicity and clarity of the Values and Principles expressed in the  Agile Manifesto.  It can empower the people doing software development in any organization, and enable us to make rapid strides to the &ldquo;land of better&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>Software development is an activity of discovery. We must take action to reveal the reality of the problem at hand, the elements of the solution, and to reveal the work that is needed to design and create the software required. This is the process of discovery.</p>
                        <p>As leaders, activators, and influencers of change in the companies we work with, it's up to us to understand the philosophy of Agile and how it embraces and  empowers the process of discovery.</p>
                        <p>I'll share my thinking about &ldquo;Pure Agile&rdquo;, and how I use it in my daily work to enhance Continuous Discovery, Learning, and Growth in the teams and companies I work with.  Let's explore together and discover the path to the future we want to create.</p>

                        <p>Woody Zuill, a Senior Consultant, Trainer, and Agile Coach, has been programming computers for 30+ years. Over the last 15+ years he has worked as an Extreme Programmer, Agile Coach, Application Development Manager, and Trainer. He believes that code must be simple, clean, and maintainable so that we can realize the Agile promise of Responding to Change, and that we must constantly &ldquo;Reflect, tune, and adjust&rdquo;. His passion is for tackling code that is hard to maintain and cleaning, refactoring, and bringing it back into a manageable state. He is a pioneer of the Mob Programming approach to teamwork in software development, and is considered one of the founders of the &ldquo;#NoEstimates&rdquo; discussion on Twitter.</p>

                    </header>

                    <section class="talk">
                        <p>I heard about one Continuous Delivery team where someone had put dancing ponies on their site as a joke. Unfortunately the customers weren't too impressed when they saw them. Perhaps unsurprisingly, none of the acceptance tests checked for dancing ponies...</p>
                        <p>The best approach for a unit test &mdash; assert only specific things &mdash; may not work as well for testing whole features. Approval testing takes the opposite standpoint &mdash; everything is interesting, and will be checked.</p>
                        <p>In this talk I’ll explain how it works in practice, and our experiences using Approval Testing at Pagero.</p>

                        <h3>Agile HR &amp; Leadership</h3>
                    </header>

                    <section class="talk">
                        <p>Pia&#150;Maria will speak about Agile HR and Agile Leadership - what is it and how can we increase the cooperation between HR and IT and facilitate for HR to understand the agile context. </p>
                        <p>The talk will also bring up principles, practices and tools for teams and managers to work in ways that simplify for people to be happy and perform together towards company goals and vision.</p>
                        <p>Some of todays traditional HR concepts do not make sense in an agile context (succession planning and career management for example) and the gap between difference in mindset and vocabulary between HR and IT is huge. </p>
                        <p>Pia-Maria's hope is to be able to bridge the gap and create a common platform for a better cooperation by increasing the insight into the HR world.</p>

                    </header>

                    <section class="talk">
                        <p>In the agile community we have come far in showcasing continuous delivery of working, valuable software as a successful delivery model. By doing so we are moving away from the short term, project centric delivery model that have been the ruling paradigm for so long. Unfortunately this paradigm still influences the strategic change management models being used when organisations change their way of working and adopt agile. The project centric delivery model as a change strategy goes against core agile principles of continuous improvements and puts the entire agile adoption work at risk.</p>
                        <p>In this talk we will explore the signals that is a sure deal for an unsustainable agile adaption based on the project centric delivery model. We will showcase our experience in trying out a different change strategy suited for complex endevours based on elements of Lean merged with Bridges Transition model. We will present how this agile change strategy is applied to the case of TeliaSonera IT Sweden, a large scale enterprise change affecting employees, vendors and business stakeholders within TeliaSonera. Finally we will share some of the signals we are picking up in this ongoing work that tells us that we are doing the right thing - right.</p>

                <p class="intro">In addition to our usual conference we offer optional add-ons of an intimate and interactive workshop with our keynote speaker Woody Zuill.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>About the workshop</h4>
                    <p>The default use of an &ldquo;estimate-driven&rdquo; approach is pervasive in software development efforts. While estimates can be useful, it is worthwhile to scrutinize our use of estimates, and to seek better ways to manage the development of software when estimates are not appropriate. [NOTE: For this session, I am referring to the use of estimates of cost, time, or effort for software projects, features, or tasks.]</p>
                    <p>There are a number of things to explore.  For example, do we really need estimates for everything we currently use them for? Are we getting a reasonable benefit from them? Is it possible to manage software development without them?</p>
                    <p>In this session we will start with an information gathering exercise to help us gain a shared idea of our current understanding of the purpose and use of estimates. From here we'll move on to examine the nature of software development projects and a few possible other ways to approach our work.</p>

                    areas. We want our speakers and attendees to share tools across our fields, both for improving your own flow
