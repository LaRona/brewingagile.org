        for improving your own flow but also for understanding other area of expertise in the product process.</p>

          <p>Often we hear that estimating a project is a must. "We can't make decisions without them" we hear often. In this session I'll present examples of how we can predict a release date of a
            project without any estimates, only relying on easily available data.</p>
          <p>I'll show how we can follow progress on a project at all times without having to rely on guesswork, and we will review how large, very large and small projects have already benefited from
            this in the past. At the end of the session you will be ready to start your own #NoEstimates journey.</p>

          <header><h3>How to enable agility in the whole organisation creating high performing companies</h3></header>
          <p>Our highest priority is to satisfy a customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
            Agile processes harness change for the customer and deliver the competitive advantage. Agile processes promote sustainable development.</p>
          <p>One of several reasons why agile techniques are so effective is that they reduce the feedback cycle between the generation of an idea and the realisation of that idea. This not only
            minimises the risk of misunderstanding, it also reduces the cost of addressing any mistakes.</p>
          <p>But most of the times we fail to take Agile further than team level. Based on my experience it is very hard to actually transform the companies and adopt Agile mindset and create high
            performing organisations.</p>
          <p>In this talk I will present a bunch of ideas that you can apply directly in your daily work that will allow you to bring your company to the next level of agility creating high performing
            organisation.</p>

          <p>How to design, validate and deliver a MVP in 3 months</p>

          <p>“Idealistic” and “groundbreaking” were two words used by the media to describe social giving startup Impossible when it was launched three years ago. This year, model, actress and
            Impossible’s founder Lily Cole worked with Pivotal Labs to develop a new mobile app that simplifies the existing experience of sharing and giving amongst communities for 100,000 users
            globally.</p>

          <p>The hybrid app &mdash; <a href="http://app.impossible.com/">Impossible People</a> &mdash; was conceived, validated and built in just three months. A common challenge to social impact
            projects is tackling the world’s toughest problems on a tight budget and a firm timeline. Learn tips and tricks for getting your biggest, most challenging ideas into production as
            efficiently as possible.</p>

          <header><h3>The systemic Scrum Master</h3></header>
          <p>Most Scrum Masters are quite fluent in "Scrum", but they lack experience in System and Complexity Thinking. Most projects don't fail because of the wrong tools, but because of people and
            a missing understanding about the system that we are all part of. I'll share stories about real world teams and their struggels with the system around them and talk about how a more
            systemic approach helped them. At the end of the talk you'll have a better understanding of system and complexity thinking and the needed mindset, as well as some tools that will help you
            on your systemic journey.</p>
          <p>IMHO the talk will be valuable for Scrum Masters, Product Owners and Agile Managers, who have a feeling that they got stuck and are in need for something different, the Scrum framework
            cannot provide.</p>

          <header><h3>The Journey from an Agile Workplace to an Adaptive Business</h3></header>
          <p>Using Agile methods and practices for the management of work does not necessarily lead to an adaptive business. </p>
          <p>So what do Lean and Agile principles tell us about the way we need to design, build and operate modern businesses? Can we design organisations that are adaptive, innovative and engaging
            for customers, employees, managers and leaders alike? The presentation will demonstrate the importance of creating the right work-climate for Agile to manage work more effectively and to
            go further ensuring the business as a whole can become highly adaptive to their customers and the marketplace.</p>

            <h4>#NoEstimates - How to improve software development predictability and profitability by focusing on what matters</h4>
          </header>
          <p>#NoEstimates is an approach to software development that arose from the observation that large amounts of time were spent over the years in estimating and improving those estimates, but
            we see no value from that investment. Indeed, according to scholars Conte, Dunmore and Shens a good estimate is one that is within 25% of the actual cost, 75% of the time.</p>
          <p>This is the same as saying: give us your money, we promise not lose more than 25% of it (with a 25% probability that we will lose a lot more). We don’t find that acceptable or productive
            for our industry. There must be better ways to manage software and product development.</p>
          <p>In this workshop we will review and analyze why we do estimates and how we can improve software and product development while reducing the time and money invested in estimating.</p>
          <p><strong>Workshop learning goals:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Decision making frameworks for projects that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>Investment models for software projects that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>Project management (risk management, scope management, progress reporting, etc.) approaches that do not require estimates</li>
            <li>The tools and arguments you need to prove the value of #NoEstimates to your boss</li>
            <li>How to get started applying #NoEstimates right away</li>
            <li>Where is #NoEstimates going and what are the likely changes to software development that will come next</li>

            <h3>Friday 4th November, Morning</h3>
            <h4>Agile Retrospectives – Much more than “What went well, what went wrong, what should be improved”</h4>
          </header>
          <p>The definition of Scrum Guide is: The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to: Inspect how
            the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools; Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and, Create a plan for
            implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.</p>
          <p>A Retrospective is much more than that. For me a retrospective is a place to raise empathy, social and emotional intelligence within the team. In this talk I will explain how Agile
            Retrospectives can be used as a team building activity and to create long lasting relationships between team members.</p>
          <p>I see most of the people running agile retrospectives in a way that does not allow learning. They run it with a bunch of activities and games but not really as a tool to enable
            sustainable learning. During my talk I will provide tools and tips that will foster sustainable learning in order for the team to continuously improve.</p>
          <p>Scrum guide definition is very focused on team level, but why not to spread the great benefits of Agile Retrospectives to the rest of the organization. If you attend my talk you will get
            access to a simple framework that will allow you to implement Agile Retrospectives into the organization level.</p>
