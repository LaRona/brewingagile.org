            <header><h4><span>Make Impacts,<br />Not Software</span></h4></header>
            <p>Software is everywhere today, and countless software products and projects die a slow death without ever making any impact. Today's planning and roadmap techniques expect the world to stand still while we deliver, and set products and projects up for failure from the very start. Even when they have good strategic plans, many organisations fail to communicate them and align everyone involved in delivery. The result is a tremendous amount of time and money wasted due to wrong assumptions, lack of focus, poor communication of objectives, lack of understanding and misalignment with overall goals.</p>
            <p>There has to be a better way to deliver! Gojko presents a possible solution, impact mapping, an innovative strategic planning method that can help you make an impact with software.</p>

            <header><h4><span>Product Integrity</span><br />&mdash; the art of saying no</h4></header>
            <p>Building great products using agile practices centers around success factors such as having a strong product vision, an accelerated feedback-loop towards users and the market and one Product Owner to rule them all. But what if you enter the Wheel of Misfortune game instead?</p>
            <p>Your product vision is steered by cognitive bias, your users and their feedback are taking your product in the wrong direction and your PO is a single point of failure?  In this talk Bea reflects on the need for more &ldquo;Product Integrity&rdquo; when building great products. The concept of &ldquo;Product Integrity&rdquo; is inspired by the term &ldquo;Conceptual Integrity&rdquo;,  which Fred P Brooks presented in his famous &ldquo;The Mythical Man-Month&rdquo; (1975) , and she applies it to agile development, especially aspects of product visioning and product ownership. She will explore the Wheel of Misfortune and explain why the life saver for your product is a two letter word - &ldquo;no&rdquo;!</p>

            <header><h4><span>UX in Agile</span><br />&mdash; How to heed the need</h4></header>
            <p>Well-functioning Scrum teams are generally quite good at delivering working software, but that does not necessarily mean that they deliver optimal business value. A more business oriented culture can be created by focusing on end-user needs and the effects needed to satisfy them. User experience has come a long way since the 2nd World War. In this session you'll learn how to integrate UX in your development to build even greater things.</p>
            <h5>How is value created?</h5>
            <p>The ideas that satisfy the needs are the ones that can create value. Products that don't satisfy any needs cannot create any value, the better you satisfy the needs the more value you can create. I will use examples to explain the principle that value is created when needs are met.</p>
            <h5>How do people express their needs?</h5>
            <p>Wouldn't it be great if we could just ask our customer what they want and then give it to them? Unfortunately, humans aren't that good at expressing their needs in speech. We can usually talk about our explicit needs, but we also have visible and latent needs that we aren't aware of. To fully understand the needs it's not enough to only talk to people, you need to observe them and interact with them.</p>
            <h5>UX so far</h5>
            <p>A brief history of User Experience so far, emphasizing the differences between traditional UX work and Agile or Lean UX work. Agile development as well as Lean startup has had great impact on the UX work, and UX professionals have had to adapt to working in short iterations, e.g. Scrum, and to focus on the Minimum Viable Product.</p>
            <h5>UX in Agile</h5>
            <p>If you want to have the best of both worlds - how do you make it work? Traditional organizations, tools and methods are not always well suited for Agile development, but there are ways of adapting to create focus on the needs of the end-users.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="about">
            <p>My interest in the human brain is what led me to study Cognitive science where I specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. I've worked with Usability and Business requirements for over 10 years, with everything from truck displays and workshop systems to public computers and healthcare telephones.</p>
            <p>My first encounter with Scrum was as a Project manager, and it was love at first sight. Since then, I've strived to combine User experience work with Agile and Lean because I believe the combination can bring the best of two worlds together to build great things!</p>

            <header><h4><span>Software Craftsmanship</span><br />&mdash; essential to agility or unnecessary vanity?</h4></header>
            <p>Craftsmanship is about skillfully creating useful, well-wrought items, for example furniture and glassware. The term sounds like it’s straight out of a description of the middle ages, yet many of the best software developers in the world have signed their names to a manifesto that values &ldquo;well-crafted software&rdquo; and pledges to &ldquo;help others learn the craft&rdquo;. What are they on about? Surely software development is a branch of engineering not carpentry? I’d like to take you through the manifesto for software craftsmanship, explain the background and what it means in practice for developers on an agile team.</p>
            <p>This is all about successful software development in the 21st century - fancy wooden chairs and hand blown wine glasses will not feature, I promise!</p>
